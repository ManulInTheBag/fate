All Servants possess deadly Noble Phantasms that are far more powerful than your regular Dota 2 abilities, meaning that getting out of position without countermeasure means certain death. Think about the pace of combat in CS:GO and you will have brief idea of how team fight is like in Fate/Another."
		"Fateanother_Servant_2"		"Fortunately, you can avoid or withstand most sticky situations with fast reflexes. The items are extrmely versatile from defense to utility, but they are all comsumables. In other words, there is no item difference that broadens the gap between the 'feed' and 'fed'; the only thing matters is your skill."
